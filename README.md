# Flexbox-Grid---Practice

Learned about css flexbox & grids , postioning etc.


Note: We can use css to add background image for a section in our website.
      To do that: 
      1. select the section and then: background-image: url('path-to-the-image');
      2. To set focus on the center of the image: background-position: center;
      3. To set zoom accross the entire image: background-size: cover;
